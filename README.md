# SCT_DS_1
# ðŸš— Car Evaluation Dataset Visualization

Dataset: Car Evaluation (UCI / Kaggle)
Type: All features are categorical

# ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

The project includes bar charts for all categorical attributes in the dataset:

# 1. Bar Charts

Displays the frequency distribution of each attribute (buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety, and class).
Helpful for identifying category balance, dominance, and trends across features.

# 2. Grid Layout

All features are arranged in a grid of subplots, making it easy to compare distributions side by side.

# 3. (Optional Extension)

Add heatmaps, pairplots, or feature-to-class comparisons (e.g., safety vs. class) for deeper EDA.

# ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x

pandas â€“ for data handling
matplotlib â€“ for plotting categorical distributions

# ðŸ“Œ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.

2. Install dependencies using:
